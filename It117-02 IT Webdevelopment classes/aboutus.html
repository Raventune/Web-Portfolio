                Southern Gourmet was created from the love of our Head Chef Raven Clark for the classical techniques and the food of her childhood.
                As a child she loved to cook but her family lived very poorly. She would watch every cooking show she could find, but most of the ingredients were too expensive. Not to be deterred, she began
                using cheap ingredients and everything the shows could teach her, she made wonderful meals for her family and even impressed the local community college's head of the culinary program.
                From there She went on to Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in New York and after a time brought her skills back home.
            </p>
            <p>
                From that journey, Southern Gourmet was born. Taking everything She has learned Chef Raven Clark has given everything she has to make this restaurant what it is today. With our staff ready
                to serve the dishes she creates. After the first year she began teaching classes to the lower income families that came thru and advertising those classes in the local newspaper. With the classes and food, She has given much to the community that she calls home and hopes to do this for many years to come.
                Though the Building may be small the love you feel from the food will make you feel like your part of one big family. Our Family. The Southern Gourmet family.
