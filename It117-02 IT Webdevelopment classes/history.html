                Southern Gourmet was created from the love of our Head Chef Raven Clark for the classical techniques and the food of her childhood.
                As a child she loved to cook but her family lived very poorly. She would watch every cooking show she could find, but most of the ingredients were too expensive. Not to be deterred, she began
                using cheap ingredients and everything the shows could teach her, she made wonderful meals for her family and even impressed the local community college's head of the culinary program.
                From there She went on to Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in New York and after a time brought her skills back home.
            </p>
            <p>
                After three years of hard work and dedication Southern gourmet has changed from the dream of one chef into the home away from home for her employees and patrons.
                Never losing sight of her upbringing, she open the classes we now offer to improve the lives of the people she grew up with and loved.
